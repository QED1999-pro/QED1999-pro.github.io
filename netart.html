<h1>Ten of Steven Spielberg's Best Movies</h1>

<p>I am an avid movie watcher and I am just passionate about movies period. I have a deep love for well-made and
entertaining movies. If I had a favorite film director, it would be Steven Spielberg. He has directed and helped 
to produce some of my favorite movies of all time including Jurassic Park as you have already discovered through
exploring my Minecraft Art and 3-D print pages. The hope with this project was to create a simple and linear and
yet fun way to illustrate just meaningful snippets from ten of his most successful and memorably iconic movies.
I did this through images of famous scenes from the movies as well as some of the most quotable lines. All of this
was done through hand coding and using html code examples from w3 schools. Below is a direct link to my Net Art
project pages that are also connected through html links.</p>
