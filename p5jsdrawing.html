<h1>P5JS Self Portrait</h1>

<p>When I hopped into Minecraft, at first I was lost as to what I wanted to do. Then I thought that it would be super fun
to commemmorate probably my favorite movie of all time: Jurassic Park by building the logo. I chose to copy a pixel art
image that I found so I had some sort of framework to go off of. At first I chose a highly ambitious size and design for
the logo. I decided to stop that one before I got too much farther and then did a more realistic one. It still ended up
turning out huge, in fact one of the biggest structures in my Digital Media art class. But I only realized after the fact
that I only had one layer of blocks and the 3-D printer would only spit out a single plain flat rectangle as it does not
recognize color, it comes out completely white. So I went back to make more changes to it giving it more three-dimensionality.
Updated image of the modified logo will be coming soon.</p>
